## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Salesforce org with Experience Cloud
- Agentforce access
- Murf.ai API key (sign up for an account on https://murf.ai/ and retrieve your own API key)

## IMPORTANT: As I make edits to the main code for improvements (check the repo for new commits!), in your terminal, use these commands to pull the latest:

First, make sure you're in the LWC directory:
```
cd agentforceChatLwc
``` 
Next, pull the newest code:
```
git pull
``` 
and then deploy it to your org:
```
sf project deploy start
``` 

### Step 0: Enable and use Code Builder (OPTIONAL)

Use Code Builder to deploy the LWC! and You could use Visual Studio Code as well, but if you don't want to leave the platform and want to learn to use the tool, consider doing this in Code Builder!

Full guide here: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/code-builder/guide/codebuilder-quickstart-intro.html

1. Navigate to Setup → Code Builder
2. Toggle on `Enable Code Builder`
3. Install the Package
4. Wait a few minutes, then navigate to the `Code Builder` app in App Launcher
5. Press the `Launch` button
6. Click `Connect an Org` to connect your Salesforce Org
   - Use your Org's Domain and login into it
   - Give your Org an alias, and save it
   - Follow the steps to login and authenticate/authorize properly
7. Set your Target Org with:
```
sfdx force:config:set target-org=(your Org alias name)
```

### Step 1: Deploy the Code

In your terminal, (in Code Builder, click into the 3 lines on top left corner → Terminal → New Terminal). Type in these commands:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/skyrmionz/agentforceChatLwc.git
   cd agentforceChatLwc
   ```

2. Deploy to your org using Salesforce CLI:
   ```
   sf project deploy start
   ```

3. Assign the permission set to users:
   ```
   sf org assign permset --name MessengerChatPermissions
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up Agentforce

## Step 2.1: Create an HTML Stylization Prompt Action

1. Create a Flex Template Prompt called "HTML Stylize", with one input `Free Text` field named "Answer"
2. Use this prompt here:
   
   "Stylize the Agent's answer: "{!$Input:Answer}" with HTML. Use the following guideline:

   Paragraphs for regular sentences: Use the `<p>` for paragraphs of regular text.
   Example: `<p>` This is a regular sentence. `</p>`
   Bold for Key Points: Use the `<b>` tag to emphasize important words or critical information.
   Example: `<b>`This is a crucial fact.`</b>`
   Italics for Additional/Supporting Details: Use the `<i>` tag for extra context or secondary notes.
   Example: `<i>`Here's some supplementary insight.`</i>`
   Line Breaks: Use `<br>` to neatly separate ideas or paragraphs. Always leave space in between them.
   Example: `<p>` Hello! `</p>` `<br>` `<p>` How are you? `</p>`
   Bullet Points: Use `<ul>` and `<li>` for any list of items or points.
   Blockquotes: Use `<blockquote>` for quotes, longer excerpts, or cited content.
   Headings: Use headings to signify titles or subsections. If you need section titles or headers, use `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.
   Example: `<h1>`Main Title`</h1>`, `<h2>`Subsection`</h2>`

   Whenever you provide an answer, ensure it is easy to read and visually structured using these HTML (and other you deem relevant) elements where appropriate.

   For any `<think>` `</think>` in the response, leave it at the very top of HTML stylized text."
3. Choose 4O as the model, save, and then activate.
4. Create an Action from the Prompt named "HTML Stylize".
   - Action Instructions: "Before returning any answer to the user, make sure to HTML stylize the response using this prompt."
   - Input "Answer" Instructions: "This is your answer to the user's query"
      - Require Input
   - Output "Prompt Response" Instructions: "This is the complete HTML stylized response to provide back to the user."
      - Show in Conversation

   Put it above the HTML stylized text you provide back."

## Troubleshooting

- If the chat fails to initialize, check your Remote Site Settings and Named Credential configuration
- If TTS is not working, verify your Murf.ai API key is correctly entered in the component configuration
- Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
- Review the Apex debug logs for server-side errors in Developer Console

## Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the chat widget by:

1. Modifying the CSS in `messengerChat.css`
2. Updating default properties in `messengerChat.js`
3. Modifying the HTML to place objects in `messengerChat.html`
4. Configuring component properties in Experience Builder
5. Add an "Image/File Processing" Prompt as an Action to the Agent so it can process them.

You can do this with the LWC on the Experience Cloud Builder:
1. Add a Murf API Key for Voice Experience
2. Do a "Search Mode" which mimics the help.salesforce.com Search Experience
3. Choose your own theme color for the component
4. Set the chatting to start the experience from Voice Mode.
